        <h3>Birth Chart in Astrology</h3><br/>
        <p class="sub">Not only the planets, but the rest of the Astros have a meaning</p>

                <h2>Sun</h2>
                <h4>Identity and Ego</h4><br/>
                <p>The sun traveling through the zodiac creates what we think of as our astrological year. In the natal chart, the sun represents who we are and who we strive to be. Unlike the moon, which represents our emotional responses, the sun stands for our most rational selves and the way we interact with the world on a daily basis. It also determines how we balance the influence of all the other planets in our personality.</p><br/>
                
            </div>
            <div class="d2">
                <h2>Moon</h2>
                <h4>Inner emotional life</h4><br/>
                <p>It's responsible for our instincts and how we react to high intensity situations. While most people are familiar with their sun sign, the position of the moon in your chart is just as important as it determines your "inner self," how you interpret emotions, and the way you listen to your heart. As the moon travels through the zodiac, its position in each sign has a distinct influence on the energy that surrounds us.</p><br/>
                
            </div>
            <div class="d3">
                <h2>Ascendant</h2>
                <h4>Facade</h4><br/>
                <p>The sun is your deepest self, the moon is your inner emotional landscape, the rising sign (or ascendant) is both your outlook on the world and the first impression you give to others. At a first meeting, job interview, or party, people will perceive you as your rising sign. As they get to know you better, they come to see the rest of your chart. This can happen at different paces depending on the relationship.</p><br/>

        <div class="tresbloquess">
            <div class="d1">
                <h2>Mercury</h2>
                <h4>Communication</h4><br/>
                <p>This planet controls all manner of communication and expression, determining how we process information and get our points across. Mercury is also responsible for logic and reason, dictating how we solve problems. So when Mercury turns retrograde, naturally we tend to see communication going haywire. </p><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="d2">
                <h2>Venus</h2>
                <h4>Love, beauty and money</h4><br/>
                <p>This planet influences how we idealize romance and relationships (i.e. what we need to feel appreciated and emotionally stimulated). And as Venus travels through the cosmos and our personal charts, we experience love and affection in radically different ways.</p><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="d3">
                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <h4>Assertiviness and aggression</h4><br/>
                <p>So naturally, this planet is all about action. Mars determines our sense of intention and aggression, and presides over conflict. This planet rules over our most primal desires, our pure "animalistic" selves (yes, this includes sex). This is the part of ourselves that defends our territory and stakes a claim not just to what we deserve, but also to what we need to survive.</p><br/>
